# PRD: SafeQuest – Gamified Safety Learning for Urban Kids

## 1. Executive Summary

**SafeQuest** is a mobile application designed to gamify real-world safety education for children (ages 6–12) living in urban environments. Through interactive scenarios, games, challenges, and role-play, the app teaches kids how to recognize, react to, and report various urban hazards including:

- Stranger danger  
- Fire safety  
- Environmental threats (pollution, extreme weather, traffic)  
- Bullying and peer pressure  
- Digital safety (optional module)  

The goal is to increase retention and real-life application of safety principles through an engaging, narrative-driven experience backed by child psychology, education research, and parental controls.
